Daar addresses this through advanced machine learning models that provide highly accurate property value predictions. In addition, it features a personalized recommendation system that analyzes user behaviorâ€”such as viewed property types, and cities to suggest listings that best match individual preferences. Together, these AI capabilities streamline property search and valuation for all stakeholders.</p>
